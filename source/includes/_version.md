# Current Version

By default, all requests receive **version 1** of the API. We encourage you to explicitly request this version via the `Accept` HTTP header. If you are using our [Ruby library](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohanakapa-ruby), this is automatically done for you.

```
Accept: application/vnd.ohanapi+json; version=1
```
