# Introduction
Welcome to the 211 OK API documentation. The [211 OK API Ruby app](https://ohana-api-211.herokuapp.com) is an interface to the data behind the [211 OK Web Search](https://211ok.org).

We provide code examples for the Shell and Ruby in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Apps Powered by Ohana API

[211OK Web Search](https://211ok.org) is a Rails application that allows you to search for and display information provided by the API in a user-friendly website.
